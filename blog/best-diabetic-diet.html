        <p>Maintaining a healthy diet is one of the most important aspects of managing diabetes effectively. The right nutritional approach can help stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce the risk of complications, and improve overall well-being.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Principles of a Diabetic Diet</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Focus on Low Glycemic Index Foods</h3>
        <p>The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels. Low-GI foods are digested and absorbed more slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar rather than spikes. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most vegetables (except potatoes)</li>
            <li>Whole grains like brown rice and quinoa</li>
            <li>Legumes such as lentils and chickpeas</li>
            <li>Most fruits (except very ripe bananas and watermelon)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Control Carbohydrate Intake</h3>
        <p>Carbohydrates have the most significant impact on blood sugar levels. It's important to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Count carbs consistently</li>
            <li>Distribute carbs evenly throughout the day</li>
            <li>Choose complex carbohydrates over simple sugars</li>
            <li>Watch portion sizes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Increase Fiber Consumption</h3>
        <p>Fiber helps slow the absorption of sugar, improves blood glucose levels, and promotes a feeling of fullness. Aim for 25-30 grams daily from sources like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetables and fruits with edible skins</li>
            <li>Whole grains</li>
            <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
            <li>Legumes</li>
        </ul>
